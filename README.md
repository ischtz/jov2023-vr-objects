# Where Was This Thing Again? Evaluating Methods to Indicate Remembered Object Positions in Virtual Reality

This repository contains the experiment code, data, and analysis for our 2024 manuscript in the *Journal of Vision* (Schuetz, Baltaretu & Fiehler, 2024). 

## Summary of Results



## Experiment Code

Note that the Unity project in the *experiment/* subfolder documents the scripts and custom scenes used to implement the pointing and placement tasks described in the paper, but is not meant to provide an "click and run" experiment. In particular, the scene and object assets used in the study are not included, both because they were provided to us by the [Scene Grammar Lab team at Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.scenegrammarlab.com/research/) (many thanks!), but also because they would have grown the size of this repository by an order of magnitude. 

Researchers interested in replicating this work or using this codebase to build their own study are encouraged to reach out to the first author, who will be able to share the (much larger) full Unity project on a case by case basis.
